This project details the chatbot project's development in Python with the help of the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The chatbot processes the user's input, categorises it, 
and then produces a response. 

A Naive Bayes classifier, educated on a corpus of annotated sentences, is then used to categorise the user's input. To produce the replies, we first classify
the user's purpose and then randomly choose a response from a set of responses that are relevant to that intent.

Natural language processing, text classification, Naive Bayes classification, stemming, and stop words were all included into the chatbot's development. The intentions of the statements
in the test data were accurately classified by the chatbot with a 90% success rate. The chatbot is an effective tool for creating automated answers to questions or comments. It's flexible 
and simple to modify to your own requirements. The chatbot has several potential uses, including but not limited to customer service, instruction, and recreation.

The code for this endeavour is split up into several "functions," each of which performs a
distinct task. The primary features are as follows:

import_data(file): To import a dataset of talks that have been tagged by humans, the
function is utilised. The function accepts a filename as an argument and outputs a dictionary
collection. One dialogue is reflected in each of the dictionaries on the list. This is some of the
data found in the dictionary:
  
    a. Textual Content: The Conversational Content.
    b. purpose: the reason for the chat.

The following procedures are used by the function to import the dataset:
  1. Launch the file.
  2. Peruse the text lines in the file.
  3. Separate the language of the dialogue from its meaning by dividing each sentence
  into two halves.
  4. Fourth, compile the conversation's content and context into a lexicon.
  5. Fifth, include the dictionary in the collection of dictionaries.


import_responses(file): It is used to load a response file. The given filename is used as
input, and the function produces a dictionary as output. This is some of the data found in the
dictionary:

    a. meaning: what was meant by the reply.
    b. reactions: A set of reactions to the purpose.

The following procedures are used by the function to import the dataset:
  1. Launch the file.
  2. Peruse the text lines in the file.
  3. Third, separate each line into its two constituent components, the response's
intended purpose and the list of possible replies to that purpose.
  4. Fourth, compile a vocabulary that includes both the goal and the possible answers.


preprocess(text): The text to be preprocessed is sent to the preprocess(text) method. The
function accepts a string and returns a dictionary containing its contents. The text is
preprocessed by the function using the following steps:
  1 First, the text has been tokenized, or segmented into its component parts (words and punctuation).
  2 The words have been "stemmed," or reconstructed from their ancestor forms.
  3 Stop words and other superfluous words are filtered out of the text.


extract_features(text): To extract features from a text, use the function
extract_features(text). The given text is processed by the function, and a dictionary of
characteristics is returned. This is some of the data found in the dictionary:
    a. Number of words in the text (word_count).
    b. The number of distinct words in the text (unique_word_count).
    c. Count of stop words in the text (optional).
    d. The number of continuous words in the text (i.e., d. non_stop_word_count).
    e. The number of occurrences of a certain part-of-speech tag in the text, denoted by the e.
    pos_tag_count variable.
    f. The number of times a certain negative part-of-speech tag appears in the text (f.
  neg_tag_count).

The steps used by the function to extract characteristics from the text are as follows:
  1. First, the text has been tokenized, or segmented into its component parts
  (words and punctuation).
  2. The words have been "stemmed," or reconstructed from their ancestor forms.
  3. Stop words and other superfluous words are filtered out of the text in step 3.
  4. The words have been annotated with their respective parts of speech.
  5. The characteristics are gleaned from the written word.


evaluate_intent_classifier(classifier): The intent classifier's effectiveness is measured by
evaluate_intent_classifier(classifier). The function receives a classifier as an input and
outputs a metrics dictionary. This is some of the data found in the dictionary:
    a. First, let's talk about classifier accuracy.
    b. the classifier's accuracy rate in b.
    c. recall The classifier's recall.
    d. The classifier's f1-score is the f1-score.
    
The function assesses the classifier by means of the following operations:
  1. To begin, a collection of test data must be classified using the classifier.
  2. The classifier's predictions are then compared to the test data's actual intentions.
  3. Third, the comparison's outcomes are used to derive the metrics in question.
   

train_intent_classifier(data): Intent classifiers may be trained with the help of the
train_intent_classifier(data) function. The input to the function is a dataset of annotated talks
produced by humans, and the output is a classifier. After training, the classifier may be used
to assign fresh discussions to one of many possible goals.

To train the classifier, the function does the following:
  1. First, we separate the data into a training set and an evaluation set.
  2. The classifier is taught using data from the training set.
  3. Third, the results of the classifier are compared against the test set.
  4. Four, the classifier is trained until it produces acceptable results on the test set.
     

The function generate_response(text) is used to generate a response to text provided by the
user. The function's input and output are both strings. The user's input is evaluated, and an
appropriate answer is returned as a string.

The steps used by the function to arrive at an answer are as follows:
  1. User input is preprocessed before it is used.
  2. The data is then fed into a machine learning model after being preprocessed.
  3. Third, an answer is produced by the machine learning model.
  4. The reply is handled after the fact.
  5. The final result of the processing is given back.


chat(): Function may pretend to have a discussion with a chatbot. The code reads a user's
query and returns a reply from the chatbot. In response to the user's input, the function
outputs the chatbot's answer.

The following procedures are used by the function to mimic a conversation:

1. User input is preprocessed before it is used.
2. The data is then fed into a machine learning model after being preprocessed.
3. Third, an answer is produced by the machine learning model.
4. The reply is handled after the fact.
5. The processed reply is output to paper.
6. Six, the next input from the user is required.
7. Seven, it keeps going till the user stops it.
